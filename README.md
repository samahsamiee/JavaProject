   for organization (not needed)

4) You'll see something called "Clone or Download" on the middle right of
   the page and copy that link

5) On terminal type the command "git clone link"

6) Now you will have a directory called JavaProject and cd into this

7) Then type "git checkout Yourname" when you type your name the first
   letter should be uppercase

9) If you are not done or done make sure you do the following commands:

	git add . <br />
	git commit "write some kinda meaningful message" <br />
	git push -u orign Yourname

10) If you go to the link and you click on "Branch master" then click your
